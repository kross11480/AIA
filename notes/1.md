High-Level Concepts:
* Building blocks of Neural Networks
* Math Kernels
* C Fundamentals

# Neural Networks

- Weights, Biases, Layers
- activations
- loss
- CNN: Backprop
- Practical Keras: Python, Tensors, autograd, custom modules, passes, optimizers, training

# Math Kernels

- relu, softmax, ….
- matmul, dot product,
- Numerical stability

# C Fundamentals

- Pointers, Pointer Arithmetic
- Structs, Composition (structs containing pointers to buffers or regs)
- Syntax: data types, Typedef, define, static, inline, File IO, bit masks
- Memory Layout (flat, 2d) and Management: stack, heap, allocation, alignment, endianness
