# **Foundation**

?‍♂️ AI Accelerators! ??️

---
# What is the Lecture about?

* ML = Data + Model + Infrastructure



---
# Organization!

---
# Personal Background: 

* Traditional Software devoured by NN 
* Suttons Bitter Lesson
* Systems Engineering over Human Ingenuity, e.g. Chess)

---
# Historical Evolution: 

* Symbolic Systems to Deep Learning. ML is part of AI

---
# Primer NN: Perceptron, XOR Crisis, Training, and Inference

---
# MNIST and LeNet-5

---
# Takeaway: 

* Machines can learn from data using neural networks
* Hidden layer enable resolving nonlinear solutions for practical problems, e.g. MNIST
* Übung: O(n) to O(n^2) memory and Compute. Calculate on Paper and Verify with pytorch
